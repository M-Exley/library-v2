# taking another go at the library after making a full-scale project with ES6 modules

# in this v2 of the library, I will:

    - use Factory Functions to return objects (books) - done
    - focus on new array methods (minimising for loops)
    - use functional programming wherever possible
    - write notes to the best of my ability
    - focus on what the functions return
    - focus on data being stored in objects
    - focus on form validation
    - try to have each module clearly defined, readable and serving minimal purpose
    - focus more on an updateUI module

# other things to focus on once finished are:

    - making an image-style carousel of the books in the library
    - clearly separate those read and those not read
    - localStorage elements
    - CSS, animation etc
