# taking another go at the library after making a full-scale project with ES6 modules

# in this v2 of the library, I will:

    - use Factory Functions to return objects (books) - done.
    - focus on new array methods (minimising for loops) - done. There are no forLoops
    - use functional programming wherever possible - done. All small functions are in their own modules
    - write notes to the best of my ability - done and then removed.
    - focus on what the functions return - done.
    - focus on data being stored in objects - done. Data is only stored in arrays here, though.
    - focus on form validation - done. This could be worked on more but I have tested my skills.
    - try to have each module clearly defined, readable and serving minimal purpose - done.
    - focus more on an updateUI module - wasn't necessary in the end but I will consider it for the next project.
    - clean everything up at the end of the dev stage in order to look presentable.

# other things to focus on once finished are:

    - making an image-style carousel of the books in the library - done but this caused a lot of problems with Webpack so I have removed it for now.
    - clearly separate those read and those not read - done. This was the last dev stage
    - CSS, animation etc. - not sure whether to spend more time on this project at the moment.
    - Re-add the clearLibrary function if it serves a purpose. At the moment I don't think it does.

    - localStorage elements - not done yet.
    - The delete button on the default book goes crazy when clicked. - deleteDiv();
